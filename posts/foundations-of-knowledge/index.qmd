# Introduction

Sextus Empiricus was a member of the Empiric School of medicine in the 2nd Century Roman Empire. He was also a Pyrrhonist[^1], which was a school of philosophy best known for various skeptical "modes" or "tropes" - reusable epistemological arguments that could be employed to resolve arguments[^2].

In his book, *Outlines of Pyrrhonism*, Sextus gives the "five tropes of Agrippa". They are listed as:

1. Assumption – The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption.
2. Circularity – The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs.
3. Infinite regress – All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity.
4. Dissent – The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.
5. Relation – All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view.

The first three (assumption, circularity, and infinite regress), , which relate to the grounding of arguments, are also known as *Munchausen's Trilemma*[^3]. The "trilemma" is that any argument must rest foundationally on one of the three options.

# Conclusion

[^1]: Except for the works of Sextus Empiricus, most of the Pyrrhonists' works are lost to time. Allegedly, Sextus Empiricus wrote ten total books. Three works survive: their republication in Latin in 1569 and Greek in 1621 led to widespread readership in the 16th-18th centuries, and influenced many enlightenment philosophers such as Hume, Hegel, Montaigne, Descarte, Pascal, Popper, etc.

[^2]: The Pyrrhonists' reason for doing this was not to attach positive or negative claims to knowledge, but to suspend judgement entirely. They believed this led to happiness by way of a state called "ataraxia" (often translated "tranquility", "unpertubedness", etc.). 

[^3]: Named for the story of Baron Munchausen pulling himself up by his bootstraps.
